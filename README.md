# Linear-Algebra

# Course Overview

This course is from the final semester of my studies. It consisted of 3 optional theory exercises and 3 mandatory projects that overall accounted for 40% of the final grade.

## Syllabus:

The syllabus covered the following topics:

- **Facts from Linear Algebra:**
  - Vector spaces, transformations, vectors, matrices.
  - Inner products, vector/matrix/function norms.
  - Special forms of matrices and Tensors.
  - Iterative methods for the solution of Linear Systems.
  
- **Classical Methods:**
  - Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR.

- **Theory of Function Approximation:**
  - Numerical optimization.
  - Least Squares problem and its variations.

- **Matrix and Tensor Decomposition:**
  - Important decompositions (QR, SVD) of matrices and tensors.
  - Applications such as PCA, LCA, etc.

- **Dimension Reduction:**
  - Low-rank approximation.

- **Numerical Methods:**
  - Numerical methods for eigenvalues/eigenvectors.
